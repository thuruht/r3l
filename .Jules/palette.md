## 2025-12-27 - Empty State "No Frequencies"
**Learning:** In a highly thematic app like this ("Mist & Glow"), generic "No results found" text breaks immersion. Using thematic language ("No frequencies found") combined with large, faint iconography (`IconBroadcast`) turns a dead-end interaction into a world-building moment.
**Action:** Always check if "empty" states can be "thematic" states. Use opacity and iconography to make them feel like part of the environment rather than system errors.
