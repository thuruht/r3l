## 2025-12-27 - Empty State "No Frequencies"
**Learning:** In a highly thematic app like this ("Mist & Glow"), generic "No results found" text breaks immersion. Using thematic language ("No frequencies found") combined with large, faint iconography (`IconBroadcast`) turns a dead-end interaction into a world-building moment.
**Action:** Always check if "empty" states can be "thematic" states. Use opacity and iconography to make them feel like part of the environment rather than system errors.

## 2025-12-28 - Focus State Visibility
**Learning:** Removing `outline: none` from inputs for aesthetic reasons breaks accessibility if not replaced. We can satisfy both by lifting the focus state to the parent container, adding a thematic "glow" (`box-shadow`) and border color change. This makes the search bar feel like it "activates" rather than just being selected.
**Action:** When using custom input styles, always implement a `focus` state on the wrapper element to maintain keyboard visibility.

## 2025-02-18 - Consistent Loading States
**Learning:** Replacing text-based loading indicators ("Loading...") with `Skeleton` loaders that match the content layout significantly improves the perception of speed and polish. It avoids layout shifts and maintains the immersive "glass" aesthetic of the application.
**Action:** When implementing lists or data-heavy views, always prefer `Skeleton` components over text placeholders.
