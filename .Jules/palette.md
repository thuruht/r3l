## 2025-12-27 - Empty State "No Frequencies"
**Learning:** In a highly thematic app like this ("Mist & Glow"), generic "No results found" text breaks immersion. Using thematic language ("No frequencies found") combined with large, faint iconography (`IconBroadcast`) turns a dead-end interaction into a world-building moment.
**Action:** Always check if "empty" states can be "thematic" states. Use opacity and iconography to make them feel like part of the environment rather than system errors.

## 2025-12-28 - Micro-Interactions in Lists
**Learning:** Replacing standard unicode arrows with styled icon buttons (Tabler Icons) for reordering lists improves touch targets and visual consistency. Adding thematic empty states ("Empty Archives") to sub-modals maintains immersion even in utility screens.
**Action:** Audit other list views (e.g. key manager, chat lists) for similar "unicode vs icon" discrepancies and generic empty states.
