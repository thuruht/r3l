- `auth_sessions` - Session tokens
- `content` - Content metadata
- `content_location` - R2 object keys
- `content_lifecycle` - Expiration tracking
- `connections` - User follows
- `bookmarks` - Saved content
- `comments` - Content comments
- `content_reactions` - Likes/reactions
- `community_archive_votes` - Archiving votes
- `messages` - Direct messages
- `notifications` - User notifications
- `workspaces` - Content organization

### API Architecture

**Public Endpoints:**
- POST /api/register
- POST /api/login
- POST /api/logout
- GET /api/content/:id
- GET /api/content/:id/comments

**Protected Endpoints (require session cookie):**
- User: profile, preferences, files, stats, visibility
- Content: upload, download, vote, react, comment, bookmark
- Social: connections, feed, messages
- Discovery: user search, network visualization
- Workspaces: create, list

### Security Features

1. Rate limiting (100 requests per 60 seconds per IP)
2. Request size limits (50MB max)
3. HttpOnly secure cookies
4. Password hashing with bcrypt
5. Session expiration
6. Input validation with Zod
7. CORS configuration
8. SQL injection prevention (prepared statements)

### Performance Optimizations

1. Durable Objects caching (5-minute TTL for network data)
2. HTTP caching headers on public content
3. Presigned URLs for R2 (reduces worker load)
4. Pagination on all list endpoints
5. Indexed database queries
