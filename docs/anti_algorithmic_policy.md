# R3L:F Anti-Algorithmic Policy

## Core Principle
R3L:F is fundamentally **anti-algorithmic** - we reject engagement optimization, content ranking, and automated recommendation systems that manipulate user behavior or attention.

## Policy Guidelines

### What We Reject
- **Engagement Optimization**: No features that maximize time-on-site, clicks, or interactions
- **Algorithmic Ranking**: No personalized content ordering based on predicted preferences  
- **Recommendation Systems**: No "you might like" or "trending" features
- **Behavioral Tracking**: No analysis of user behavior for prediction or optimization
- **Attention Manipulation**: No dark patterns, infinite scroll, or notification spam

### What We Allow
- **Chronological Ordering**: Time-based content feeds (newest first)
- **User-Controlled Filters**: Tag-based, location-based, and explicit user filtering
- **Random Discovery**: Truly random content selection (using crypto.getRandomValues)
- **User-Initiated Search**: Direct search queries with transparent, non-personalized results
- **Community Voting**: Democratic archival decisions without algorithmic weighting

### AI Usage Constraints
If AI is used in the future, it must be:
- **Opt-in Only**: Users explicitly choose to enable AI features
- **Transparent**: AI processing is clearly labeled and explained
- **Non-Personalizing**: AI cannot create user profiles or personalized outputs
- **Limited Scope**: AI restricted to content moderation, accessibility, or user-requested analysis
- **No Learning**: AI cannot learn from user behavior or improve recommendations

### View Count and Metrics
- View counts may be displayed for transparency but cannot influence content ranking
- Archive thresholds must be based on explicit community votes, not engagement metrics
- Any use of view counts in features must be conservative and anti-optimization

### Analytics Policy
- **Privacy-First**: No PII collection, differential privacy for aggregates
- **User Control**: Users can opt-out of all analytics
- **Transparency**: All collected metrics must be documented and justified
- **No Behavioral Profiles**: Data cannot be used to build user behavior models

## Implementation Requirements
- All new features must be reviewed against this policy
- Any quantitative rules (thresholds, calculations) must be documented and justified
- Regular audits to identify algorithmic drift in features
- User education about how R3L:F differs from algorithmic platforms

## Enforcement
- Developers must acknowledge this policy before contributing
- Features that violate this policy will be rejected or disabled
- Community feedback on potential violations is encouraged

*This policy ensures R3L:F remains true to its vision of user-controlled, intentional social interaction.*
