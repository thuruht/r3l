## Status Report

**Overall Progress**: 90% Complete

The R3L:F project has been successfully realigned with the original Rel-F vision. All core functionality is in place, including ephemeral content with 7-day expiry, community archiving through voting, anti-algorithmic search, random communique discovery, and secure direct messaging with attachments.

The codebase is well-organized with proper separation of concerns between handlers, and the database migrations provide a clear path for setup. All HTML files have been updated to use relative paths, preparing the project for deployment to r3l.distorted.work.

The backend infrastructure is now robust with proper implementation of Durable Objects for real-time features, with proper hibernation handling and error management. The messaging system supports attachments and is fully integrated with the notification system.

The remaining tasks are focused on UI enhancements, final verification, and ensuring a seamless user experience with the messaging and notification features.

## Next Steps

1. Complete drawer customization functionality
2. Add archive voting UI components
3. Finalize messaging UI with attachment support
4. Run final verification of all relative URLs
5. Test all features for deployment readiness

With these steps completed, the R3L:F project will be fully ready for deployment to its final location.
