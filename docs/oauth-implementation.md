# OAuth Implementation with Cloudflare Workers OAuth Provider

This document outlines the implementation of OAuth authentication in the R3L:F application using the `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` library.

## Overview

We've implemented a standardized OAuth 2.1 provider framework that supports both GitHub and ORCID authentication. This implementation follows modern security practices and provides a consistent authentication experience across the application.

## Implementation Details

### 1. OAuth Provider Setup

We created an OAuth provider using the Cloudflare Workers OAuth Provider library:

- Created a new file: `src/auth/oauth-provider.ts`
- Defined default and API handlers
- Configured API routes that require authentication
- Set up OAuth endpoints for authorization, token exchange, and client registration
- Implemented error handling

### 2. Environment Configuration

Updated the environment configuration to support the OAuth provider:

- Added `OAUTH_PROVIDER` binding to the `Env` interface
- Added `OAUTH_KV` binding in wrangler.jsonc to store OAuth tokens securely
- Ensured all required environment variables are defined: 
  - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
  - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI`
  - `ORCID_CLIENT_ID`
  - `ORCID_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `ORCID_REDIRECT_URI`

### 3. Worker Integration

Updated the worker.ts file to use the OAuth provider:

- Imported the OAuth provider creation function
- Set up OAuth clients during worker initialization
- Updated the fetch handler to use the OAuth provider

### 4. Authorization UI

Created a new authorization page:

- Created `authorize.html` with a clean, user-friendly interface
- Implemented client information display
- Added scope rendering and explanation
- Provided approve and deny options with clear explanations
- Ensured consistent styling with the rest of the application

### 5. Client Registration

Implemented helper functions to register OAuth clients:

- Added `setupOAuthClients` function to register ORCID and GitHub clients
- Configured client metadata including names, URIs, and logos
- Set up proper redirect URIs for the OAuth flow

## Benefits

1. **Standards Compliance**: Implements OAuth 2.1 with PKCE support
2. **Security**: End-to-end encryption for tokens and sensitive data
3. **Flexibility**: Supports multiple OAuth providers (GitHub, ORCID)
4. **User Experience**: Clean, consistent authorization UI
5. **Maintainability**: Uses a standardized library rather than custom implementation

## Usage

The OAuth flow works as follows:

1. Users click "Login with GitHub" or "Login with ORCID" on the login page
2. They are redirected to the appropriate provider's authorization page
3. After approving, they are redirected back to our application
4. The OAuth provider validates the response and creates a session
5. The user is now authenticated and can access protected resources

## Environment Requirements

Before deploying, ensure the following:

1. Create a KV namespace for OAuth tokens and update the ID in wrangler.jsonc
2. Set up the required environment variables using wrangler secret put
3. Register applications with GitHub and ORCID to obtain client credentials
4. Update redirect URIs in the provider dashboards if necessary

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly authentication system for R3L:F using standardized OAuth flows and modern security practices.
