Bugs and Issues Found:

1. Duplicate Durable Object Class:
   - Both realtime.ts and collaboration.ts define the same ConnectionsObject, VisualizationObject, and CollaborationRoom classes
   - This could cause registration conflicts and unexpected behavior in production
   - SOLUTION: Consolidated to single file realtime-fixed.ts with proper implementations
   - STATUS: FIXED - Consolidated classes in realtime.ts

2. Messaging Handler Issues:
   - In src/handlers/messaging.ts, the sendMessage method signature in implementation doesn't match usage in router.ts
   - Implementation: fromUserId, toUserId, content, isEncrypted, env
   - Router usage: fromUserId, toUserId, content, attachments, env
   - SOLUTION: Updated messaging.ts with method signature that handles attachments properly
   - STATUS: FIXED - Updated method to handle attachments

3. Durable Object Error Handling:
   - ConnectionsObject doesn't implement proper error handling as per Cloudflare best practices
   - Missing retryable error handling in fetch implementations
   - SOLUTION: Added robust error handling following Cloudflare best practices in realtime.ts
   - STATUS: FIXED - Implemented proper error handling

4. Durable Object Hibernation:
   - No implementation of the alarm() method to handle hibernation properly
   - The wrangler.jsonc has "durable_object_alarms" flag enabled but not used
   - SOLUTION: Implemented alarm() method in realtime.ts to handle cleanup during hibernation
   - STATUS: FIXED - Implemented alarm() method

5. Database Schema Issues:
   - The direct_messages table schema in migration doesn't match the handler implementation
   - Messages use isEncrypted but router calls with attachments
   - SOLUTION: Created new migration 012_messaging_attachments.sql to add attachments column
   - STATUS: FIXED - Migration applied locally and remotely

6. Worker.ts Import Issue:
   - worker.ts imports from './collaboration' but should be importing from both './collaboration' and './realtime'
   - SOLUTION: Updated worker.ts to import from the consolidated realtime.ts
   - STATUS: FIXED - Updated imports

7. Missing Internal API Handlers:
   - The ConnectionsObject Durable Object doesn't handle internal API paths like '/notify' and '/message'
   - These are called in notification.ts and messaging.ts but not implemented
   - SOLUTION: Added handlers for these internal API paths in realtime.ts
   - STATUS: FIXED - Implemented internal API paths

8. Missing TypeScript Types:
   - DurableObjectState is used but not properly defined/imported
   - SOLUTION: Added proper imports from Cloudflare Workers types
   - STATUS: FIXED - Added imports

9. Redundant Code:
   - collaboration.ts and realtime.ts contain identical implementations
   - SOLUTION: Consolidated to a single file realtime.ts
   - STATUS: FIXED - Removed redundant code

10. Inconsistent Method Signatures:
    - getUserConversations has different parameter lists between handler and router
    - SOLUTION: Updated method signatures to be consistent
    - STATUS: FIXED - Aligned parameters in getUserConversations

11. Missing Methods in Messaging Handler:
    - getConversationMessages method referenced in router but not implemented in handler
    - SOLUTION: Added the missing method with correct parameter order
    - STATUS: FIXED - Implemented getConversationMessages method

Current Status:
- All identified bugs have been fixed in the codebase
- All migrations have been applied both locally and remotely
- Message attachments are now fully supported in the backend
- The realtime system properly handles internal API paths and hibernation
- Consistent method signatures across all handlers

Next Steps:
1. Test messaging functionality with attachments in the frontend
2. Verify notification delivery works correctly
3. Ensure all frontend components properly display attachment information
4. Document the updated API interfaces for future reference
5. Monitor the system for any remaining issues
