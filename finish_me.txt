   - Ensure non-algorithmic content discovery
   - STATUS: PARTIAL - Basic search exists, needs enhancement

Bugs and Issues Found:

1. Duplicate Durable Object Class:
   - Both realtime.ts and collaboration.ts define the same ConnectionsObject, VisualizationObject, and CollaborationRoom classes
   - This could cause registration conflicts and unexpected behavior in production
   - SOLUTION: Consolidated to single file realtime-fixed.ts with proper implementations
   - STATUS: FIXED - Consolidated classes in realtime.ts

2. Messaging Handler Issues:
   - In src/handlers/messaging.ts, the sendMessage method signature in implementation doesn't match usage in router.ts
   - Implementation: fromUserId, toUserId, content, isEncrypted, env
   - Router usage: fromUserId, toUserId, content, attachments, env
   - SOLUTION: Updated messaging.ts with method signature that handles attachments properly
   - STATUS: FIXED - Updated method to handle attachments

3. Durable Object Error Handling:
   - ConnectionsObject doesn't implement proper error handling as per Cloudflare best practices
   - Missing retryable error handling in fetch implementations
   - SOLUTION: Added robust error handling following Cloudflare best practices in realtime.ts
   - STATUS: FIXED - Implemented proper error handling

4. Durable Object Hibernation:
   - No implementation of the alarm() method to handle hibernation properly
   - The wrangler.jsonc has "durable_object_alarms" flag enabled but not used
   - SOLUTION: Implemented alarm() method in realtime.ts to handle cleanup during hibernation
   - STATUS: FIXED - Implemented alarm() method

5. Database Schema Issues:
   - The direct_messages table schema in migration doesn't match the handler implementation
   - Messages use isEncrypted but router calls with attachments
   - SOLUTION: Created new migration 012_messaging_attachments.sql to add attachments column
   - STATUS: FIXED - Migration applied locally and remotely

6. Worker.ts Import Issue:
   - worker.ts imports from './collaboration' but should be importing from both './collaboration' and './realtime'
   - SOLUTION: Updated worker.ts to import from the consolidated realtime.ts
   - STATUS: FIXED - Updated imports

7. Missing Internal API Handlers:
   - The ConnectionsObject Durable Object doesn't handle internal API paths like '/notify' and '/message'
   - These are called in notification.ts and messaging.ts but not implemented
   - SOLUTION: Added handlers for these internal API paths in realtime.ts
   - STATUS: FIXED - Implemented internal API paths

8. Missing TypeScript Types:
   - DurableObjectState is used but not properly defined/imported
   - SOLUTION: Added proper imports from Cloudflare Workers types
   - STATUS: FIXED - Added imports

9. Redundant Code:
   - collaboration.ts and realtime.ts contain identical implementations
   - SOLUTION: Consolidated to a single file realtime.ts
   - STATUS: FIXED - Removed redundant code

10. Inconsistent Method Signatures:
    - getUserConversations has different parameter lists between handler and router
    - SOLUTION: Updated method signatures to be consistent
    - STATUS: FIXED - Aligned parameters in getUserConversations

11. Missing Methods in Messaging Handler:
    - getConversationMessages method referenced in router but not implemented in handler
    - SOLUTION: Added the missing method with correct parameter order
    - STATUS: FIXED - Implemented getConversationMessages method

12. Notifications Schema Issue:
    - The migration 011_notifications_update.sql assumes the existence of a notifications table with a 'read' column
    - The notifications table either doesn't exist or doesn't have the expected schema
    - SOLUTION: Created a new migration 013_fix_notifications_schema.sql to properly create the notifications table
    - STATUS: FIXED - Migration applied locally and remotely

Current Status:
- All identified bugs have been fixed in the codebase
- Notification system schema fixed with new migration 013_fix_notifications_schema.sql
- Migration applied both locally and remotely
- Message attachments are now fully supported in the backend
- The realtime system properly handles internal API paths and hibernation
- Consistent method signatures across all handlers

Additional Issues Identified:

1. Map Feature Path Issue:
   - Incorrect import path in map.html: './src/globe/globe-visualizer.js'
   - Should be: '/src/globe/globe-visualizer.js' (without the leading dot)
   - SOLUTION: Updated import path in map.html
   - STATUS: FIXED

2. Missing API Implementation:
   - Many API endpoints in router.ts return notFoundResponse()
   - This causes features to fall back to demo data even for authenticated users
   - SOLUTION: Implement missing API endpoints in router.ts
   - STATUS: FIXED - Implemented all missing API endpoints in router.ts

3. Notification UI Integration:
   - While backend notifications are working, UI components might not be properly displaying them
   - Issues identified:
     - Notification container CSS had conflicting display properties (both 'none' and 'flex')
     - Notification toggle wasn't properly showing/hiding the container
     - Missing debug logging made it difficult to trace issues
     - CSS linting error on -webkit-line-clamp without standard line-clamp property
   - SOLUTION: 
     - Fixed CSS conflicts in notifications.css
     - Added detailed debug logging to notification component
     - Improved notification toggle logic to properly show/hide panel
     - Fixed CSS linting error by adding standard line-clamp property
     - Enhanced notification initialization in navigation.js
   - STATUS: FIXED

4. Authentication Detection Inconsistency:
   - Some features have inconsistent logic for detecting authenticated users
   - Some use cookie checks, others use JWT validation
   - SOLUTION: Standardize authentication detection across all features
   - STATUS: FIXED - Created a standardized getAuthenticatedUser method and updated all routes to use it

Next Steps:
1. Test all implemented API endpoints to ensure they're working correctly
2. Test frontend integration with the new API endpoints
3. Update frontend components to properly use the standardized API responses
4. Set up a user settings menu for location and visibility preferences
5. Document the updated API interfaces for future reference
6. Monitor the system for any remaining issues
