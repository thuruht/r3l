# OAuth Cookie Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary
The current OAuth implementation has issues with setting and validating cookies correctly, specifically:

1. The session cookie (`r3l_session`) is not being set correctly during GitHub/ORCID OAuth callback
2. Cross-origin cookie policies (SameSite) are not configured correctly for production HTTPS environments
3. The `/api/auth/validate` endpoint fails with 401 even when auth state cookie is present
4. Router code has syntax errors and duplicate handlers

## Solution

We've created a dedicated cookie handling utility and fixed the router and auth handler to properly set cookies that work across all environments.

### 1. Created a Cookie Helper Module (`cookie-helper.ts`)

This new module centralizes cookie management to ensure consistent cookie creation:

- Properly handles SameSite attribute based on the connection security (None for HTTPS, Lax for localhost)
- Adds Secure attribute when using HTTPS
- Creates both HttpOnly session cookie and JavaScript-accessible auth state cookie
- Provides utility functions for creating and clearing cookies

### 2. Fixed the Router (`fixed-router.ts`)

- Removed duplicate GitHub callback handler
- Fixed syntax errors in route handlers
- Used new cookie helper module for consistent cookie handling
- Added debug endpoints for troubleshooting
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 3. Enhanced the Auth Handler (`fixed-auth.ts`)

- Added extensive debug logging to the GitHub OAuth flow
- Improved error handling with detailed error messages
- Better token exchange and user profile fetch error reporting

### 4. Added Debug Tooling

- Callback pages now include code to detect and fix missing cookies
- Created a new debug endpoint (`/api/debug/cookie-check`) to inspect cookie status
- Created `test-auth.html` for manual testing of authentication cookies

## How to Apply the Fix

We've created a script that will apply all these changes:

```bash
./fix-oauth-cookies.sh
```

This script will:
1. Back up your current files to a timestamped directory
2. Install the cookie helper module
3. Replace the router and auth handler with the fixed versions
4. Clean up temporary files

After running the script, you should:
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the changes: `npx wrangler deploy`
3. Test the OAuth flow with the debug tools at `/check-oauth-status.html` and `/test-auth.html`

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after applying the fix:

1. Check the browser console for any errors during the OAuth callback
2. Use the `/check-oauth-status.html` page to diagnose cookie and authentication status
3. Verify your GitHub/ORCID OAuth configuration in Wrangler secrets
4. Check the Workers logs in the Cloudflare dashboard for detailed error messages

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to exchange code for token"**: Check that your GitHub/ORCID client ID and secret are correctly set in Wrangler secrets
2. **"Invalid GitHub response"**: The GitHub API may be rate-limiting requests or returning an error response
3. **"No auth state found"**: The cookies are not being set correctly, check cross-origin settings and HTTPS status

## Future Improvements

1. Use a more robust session management system instead of cookies
2. Add CSRF protection to the authentication flow
3. Implement token refresh mechanism
4. Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
