# R3L:F Project Comprehensive Summary

## Project Overview
R3L:F (Relationship:Formation) is a platform designed to facilitate authentic human connections, emphasizing ephemeral content, community-driven archiving, and non-algorithmic exploration. The project aligns with a philosophy of genuine human interaction, privacy, and anti-surveillance capitalism.

## Technical Foundation
- **Backend**: Node.js (>=18), TypeScript (strict, ES2021, WebWorker)
- **Infrastructure**: Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects, KV, D1, R2
- **Authentication**: JWT-based (no third-party providers)
- **Database**: SQL migrations for a relational schema
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with SPA-like navigation
- **Visualization**: D3.js for association web, Leaflet.js for map
- **Security**: Input sanitization, HTML sanitization (DOMPurify), JWT validation, rate limiting
- **Performance**: Request batching, memory caching, database query caching, performance indexes

## Core Features
1. **User Management**
   - Registration, login, profile management
   - Avatar upload and customization
   - User search and connections
   - Privacy settings

2. **Content**
   - Communiques (public/private toggle- this should toggle between editing and viewing the public appearance* important, unimmplemented? please correct) **ADD to TODO!!
   - Ephemeral content lifecycle
   - Community archiving system
   - Content associations and tagging
   - Drawers (public profiles)

3. **Visualization**
   - Association web (D3.js)
   - Geographic map (Leaflet.js)
   - Network exploration

4. **Communication**
   - Real-time direct messaging
   - Notifications system
   - File attachments
   - Collaboration features

5. **Search & Discovery**
   - Non-algorithmic content discovery
   - Tag-based search
   - Random exploration
   - "Lurker in the Mist" mode

## Codebase Architecture
- `/src/router.ts`: Main API router integrating all handlers
- `/src/handlers/`: Domain-specific handlers (file, user, content, etc.)
- `/src/utils/`: Utilities for sanitization, caching, validation, logging
- `/src/middleware/`: Rate limiting and request processing
- `/src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
- `/src/validators/`: Request/response validation schemas
- `/src/migrations/`: Database migration system
- `/public/`: Frontend HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Performance & Security Optimizations
1. **Performance**
   - Request batching for globe/map data
   - Memory caching for frequently accessed data
   - KV-based query result caching
   - Database performance indexes
   - Frontend asset optimization

2. **Security**
   - Input sanitization for all user inputs
   - HTML sanitization using DOMPurify (frontend and backend)
   - JWT validation and expiration checks
   - Rate limiting middleware
   - File upload validation
   - Custom error types and handling

## Frontend Components
1. **Pages**
   - Home/Index: Main entry point and dashboard
   - Profile: Personal settings and preferences
   - Drawer: Public profile and communique
   - Map: Geographic visualization
   - Network: Association web visualization
   - Random: Random content discovery
   - Search: Content and user search
   - Help/FAQ: Comprehensive documentation
   - About: Project information
   - Sitemap: Navigation overview

2. **UI Elements**
   - Navigation bar with dropdowns
   - Footer with links
   - Communique editor with sanitization
   - Avatar upload and selection
   - User search and connection interface
   - Messaging interface
   - Notification display

## Philosophy Alignment
The codebase has been aligned with the R3L:F philosophy:
1. **Ephemeral Content**: Content has a natural lifecycle with community-driven archiving
2. **Anti-Algorithmic**: Exploration is driven by human choice, not algorithms
3. **"Lurker in the Mist"**: Users can explore without being tracked
4. **Community Archiving**: Community decides what content is valuable
5. **Association Web**: Content is connected through meaningful relationships
6. **Privacy-Focused**: User data is protected, no third-party authentication

## Deployment & Operations
- Wrangler for deployment to Cloudflare Workers
- Environment variable validation
- Structured logging
- Error tracking and monitoring
- Database migrations system
