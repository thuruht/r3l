// src/stubs/cloudflare-workers-stub.js
// DEPRECATED: This build-time stub was used to allow importing a virtual
// `cloudflare:workers` module during webpack builds. Modern builds should not
// rely on this. We keep a minimal, well-documented stub to avoid breaking CI
// until a build-time replacement is implemented.

// ARCHIVE NOTICE
// This stub was archived to /archive/legacy-fixed/src/stubs-cloudflare-workers-stub.js
// Modern build configurations should not rely on this stub. It was retained
// only to preserve previous build behavior during migration.
