// src/cookie-fixer.js
// DEPRECATED: This file contained an ad-hoc script used during a migration to
// adjust Set-Cookie handling inside router source files. Cookie handling has
// since been implemented in production code (`src/cookie-helper.ts`) and the
// auth handlers. Keeping this file around can be confusing and dangerous, so
// we replace it with a harmless deprecation stub.

// ARCHIVE NOTICE
// This file was archived to /archive/legacy-fixed/src/cookie-fixer.js
// Cookie-fixer was a temporary migration helper and is deprecated. See
// src/cookie-helper.ts for the production implementation.

module.exports = { ARCHIVE_NOTICE: 'moved to archive/legacy-fixed/src/cookie-fixer.js' };
