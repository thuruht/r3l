The shorthand "sym" and "a‑sym" are evocative of the concepts of symmetric and asymmetric relationships:

    Sym (Symmetric):
        Implies a mutual, bidirectional connection where both parties explicitly agree to the relationship.
        It references the idea of balance and reciprocity—much like the prefix “sym-” in words like symbiosis or symmetry, where things are in harmonious alignment.
        In social networks, this is akin to a friendship where both users are fully aware and consenting to the connection.

    A‑sym (Asymmetric):
        Refers to unidirectional or non-mutually confirmed associations.
        This could be derived from incidental interactions, proximity-based associations, or interactions that don’t require explicit, mutual consent.
        It mirrors the concept of asymmetry in relationships—similar to one-sided following or incidental network encounters, where the connection doesn’t necessarily reflect an equal bond.

Thus, the use of these terms in the system underscores a design that distinguishes between intentionally curated, strong relationships (sym) and more organic, emergent, and potentially one-sided associations (a‑sym). This dual approach allows for both deliberate community building and serendipitous discovery while preserving user control and privacy.
